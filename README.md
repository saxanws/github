## Technology use

For this project i use **React.Js**, **Material UI** (by Google), and **Redux**.

## Code Structure

I see programming like building a structure with lego üß±, each little block put together to create the final structure. So, I beleive in dividing up my project in smaller components. That helps with debuging üêõ, and reduce the complexity of the application. In this project i brake in multiple smaller compnents how it show in the code down bellow ‚¨áÔ∏è.
